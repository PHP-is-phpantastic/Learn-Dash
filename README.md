# Learn Dash
I personally like the Learn Dash. It is one of the best learning management systems out there. 
It can be integrated easily with the plugins like WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, BuddyPress, MemberPress, PayPal, Stripe, etc. 
The following functionalities can be created with it. 

Multi-tier courses  <br>
Add custom colors & logos <br>
Drip-feed content  <br>
Advanced quizzing  <br>
Lesson timers  <br>
Course prerequisites  <br>
Learner Focus Mode  <br>
Forums  <br>
Course points  <br>
Certificates & badges <br>
E-commerce support (one-time purchases, subscriptions, bundles, and more) <br>
Learner profiles   <br>
Automatic notifications   <br>
Group management  <br>
